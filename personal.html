  <center><h2>Faith: Staying Grounded in Values</h2>
  <img src="per2.webp"  alt="faith" class="image"></center>
  <p>Faith keeps us anchored when the world becomes overwhelming. It reminds us that even in moments of confusion or doubt, we are never walking alone. 
     Through faith, we learn to be patient with others, to listen with compassion, and to offer understanding instead of judgment.
     It teaches us that every person we meet carries their own burdens, hopes, and silent battles, and that a small act of kindness can make a difference far greater than we realize.
     Faith encourages us to choose gentleness when tempers rise, to offer comfort when someone feels unseen, and to extend grace even when it’s difficult. 
     It guides us to become a source of peace in the lives of others to lift them up through our words, our presence, and our willingness to care.
      When we act with love, we create spaces where people feel safe, welcomed, and valued.</p>
  <div class="quote">“Let your light shine before others.” – Matthew 5:16</div>
  <p>By reflecting God’s love in the way we treat people through patience, generosity, forgiveness, and sincerity we become beacons of hope in their lives.
     When our actions shine with kindness, others are reminded of their own worth and are inspired to share that same light with those around them. 
     In this way, faith doesn’t just guide us; it connects us, strengthens our relationships, and helps us build a world where compassion is felt and shared freely.</p>

  <center><h2>Integrity: Doing What Is Right, Even When Unseen</h2>
  <img src="per1.jpg" alt="integrity" class="image"></center>
  <p>Integrity means choosing honesty even in the simplest situations, like helping others that are in need, and being truthful everytime, even when unnoticed.
     These actions, though sometimes small, reflect the depth of our character.
     Integrity also becomes visible in the way we treat the people around us. 
     It means speaking with kindness, practicing empathy, and choosing what is right even when it is not convenient. 
     Whether we are offering encouragement, standing up for fairness, or admitting our mistakes, we show others that our words and actions can be trusted.</p>
  <div class="quote">“Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching.” – C.S. Lewis</div>
  <p>When we live by this principle, we not only strengthen our own character but also inspire others to act with honesty, respect, and sincerity. 
    Through integrity, we build relationships rooted in trust and create environments where truth and fairness can thrive.</p>
