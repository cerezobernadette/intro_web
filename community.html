      Community service and advocacy focus on helping others and creating positive change in society. 
      Through service, we show care and responsibility by responding to the needs of our community.
      Advocacy allows us to use our voices wisely to promote fairness, respect, and awareness.

    <p>
      Community service is about giving time, effort, and care to support others and improve the place we live in.
      Activities such as charity drives, clean-up programs, and outreach projects teach us teamwork, empathy, and responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiences show that even small acts of kindness can have a meaningful impact and help build a stronger, more caring community.

    </center>
    <p>
      Advocacy encourages individuals to stand up for what is right and fair.
      By sharing accurate information and using technology responsibly, we can raise awareness about important social issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      When advocacy is guided by respect and integrity, it inspires others to participate in positive change and work together for a better future.
